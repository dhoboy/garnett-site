        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Garnett is a treasure! Her wealth of knowledge, supportive & calm demeanor, and ability to cue the exercise or position/pose make her the perfect coach. I am constantly in awe of how Garnett can see and explain form and alignment, drawing upon her extensive training in Alexander Technique, yoga, Pilates, and more. Each session is just the right combination of challenge, stretching, and recovery. I wholeheartedly recommend Garnett!

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Garnett Mellen has been my personal trainer for one year.  We started at ACAC and have recently been meeting online.  When we started, I was 68 years old, ache-y in lots of places, in pain from sciatica, and struggling with energy, strength and balance.  I did not like exercising, especially by myself, nor did I like many of the larger classes, where I felt anonymous.  I needed encouragement to engage in exercise and guidance to do what would help me the most.  Garnett's patience, warmth, kindness and gentle humor provided the safety and encouragement I needed. Her broad background in Alexander Technique, Yoga, Pilates, Qigong and the use of equipment, including my favorite, a balance ball, provided both variety and ways to integrate different practices that were enjoyable and specific for my needs and inclinations. Garnett has consistently been responsive, flexible, observant and intuitive in our work together.  She reminds me to "find where the ease is."  Little by little, together, we discovered what works for me and it continues to evolve.  I'm 69 now and I feel younger than I did a year ago.  I am stronger, rarely achey, no longer suffering from sciatica, and my balance is much better.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>As I have been Garnett’s student in the past I was glad to reconnect with her recently to train online. I so appreciate her eclectic style of teaching and awareness of individual student needs as she adapt classes to those needs. Her quiet speech and calm demeanor are just what I need to center myself and gain more awareness of my body and connection to my internal and emotional state.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>I have worked with Garnett for personal training using the VHPO online platform for the past two months during the COVID crisis.   With remarkable patience and a soothing voice, she has taught me to use a routine using the Alexander Technique.  She cued me virtually, using a gentle approach to help me “find the ease”.  As a result, my arthritis and posture have improved dramatically and my sanity intact.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Garnett has a lovely demeanor: she is centered, low-key, and gentle.  She seriously considered my body mechanics, yet her light heart and smiling eyes put me completely at ease.  My sessions with her were very comfortable and soothing.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Garnett provided a safe, welcoming, and healing environment for my introduction to the Alexander Technique. She is a gifted and skilled practitioner with a gentle and confident touch that guides and relaxes. New to Alexander Technique, I was amazed that the subtle touch and suggestions could make such a difference, but consistently, during the week after each of my appointments, my limbs would feel looser, my neck freer, my back nimble and stronger, and overall, my body felt at ease.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>My work with Garnett was unlike other Alexander Technique experiences I had had previously. Firstly, our sessions included an educational/instructive component, which I found most helpful for teaching specific techniques to undo old patterns of 'holding' my body, which would invariably cause stress on my neck and arms. Next, Garnett was gentle and thoughtfully considered each movement before asking me to engage it. Lastly, the 'table-time' flew by each session, after which, upon standing from the table, I found that I had been extremely relaxed, and nearly floated to my car! This last piece is my best barometer for gauging the success and benefit of any body/energy/healing work.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>The AT work with Garnett allowed me to observe, experience and reorient myself in mind, muscle and posture. I was impressed to discover through the gentle manipulations what mobility, extension and coordination my body offered through another's guiding touch.  I was able to immediately apply self-correction to find a more ease-ful manner of holding my body through the sometimes difficult physical work I was doing as well as during rest, meditation and everyday activities. I continue to experiment to find optimal positions, especially for my shoulders. One of the most important observations that Garnett helped me see was how I could use much less effort to accomplish any task. The mindful quality of her hands, voice and presence is an inspiration for more awareness and helped me and my body recall the lesson time together.

        <i className="fas fa-quote-left"></i>I highly recommend Garnett as a curious, attentive and relaxed practitioner of the Alexander Technique.The sessions felt great and what's more, I had plenty to work with on my own, between sessions. I enjoyed participating in my own process of coming into better balance.
