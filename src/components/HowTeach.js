        <span>Intro</span>
        Do you strive to be more active physically and feel confident in your ability to move different parts of your body safely, smoothly and efficiently?  
        If so, you will benefit from my work, which is a synthesis of multiple disciplines, including Alexander Technique, personal training, Pilates, Yoga, Qi Gong, and even waltz. 
      </p>
      <p className="blurb">
        The Alexander practice is my foundation. I became an AmSAT certified Alexander Technique teacher at the Alexander Technique Training Center in Charlottesville in 2012. 
        I blend in the other disciplines to suit individual client needs and desires to explore exercising safely and with confidence.
      </p>
      <p className="blurb">
        You can take a series Alexander Technique lessons, explore personal training, or both.
      </p>
      <p className="blurb">
        I teach online using one of the currently available meeting platforms, and also in-person, observing the appropriate COVID safety precautions.

        Through an initial discussion, we will talk about which type of services would serve you best, what length sessions to schedule, and where to meet.

        <span>Package rates?</span>
        The costs vary depending on how many times you would like to meet. I can send a rate sheet upon request.

        <span>A Brief Note</span>
        To begin working together, there is a very short questionnaire I will ask you to complete prior to our first meeting. I will also ask you about your current level of health so that I can customize the program to your needs.
